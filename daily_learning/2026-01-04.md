## Focus
Hirerichal clustering.

## Learning
- here we have two approach - Divisive and Agglomerative
- Dandrogram
- it is an unsupervised clustering algorithm
- linkage - single, centroid, mean

## Action
Studied core concepts, working principles, and use cases.

## Friction
Need more intuition on cluster evaluation.

## Next
Implement small examples and visualize results.
