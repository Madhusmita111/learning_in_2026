## Focus
Support Vector Machines and K-Means clustering.

## Learning
- SVM finds an optimal hyperplane with maximum margin
- Role of kernel functions in handling non-linear data
- K-Means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm
- Importance of choosing the right value of K
- Difference between supervised (SVM) and unsupervised (K-Means) learning

## Action
Studied core concepts, working principles, and use cases.

## Friction
Need more intuition on kernel selection and cluster evaluation.

## Next
Implement small examples and visualize results.
