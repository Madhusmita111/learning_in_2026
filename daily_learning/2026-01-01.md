## Focus
Regression models and evaluation techniques.

## Learning
- Linear regression (assumptions and interpretation)
- Difference between linear and polynomial regression
- Logistic regression for classification
- Role of OLS in parameter estimation
- Basics of KNN and distance-based learning
- Meaning of MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²

## Action
Reviewed theory and examples of regression models and evaluation metrics.

## Friction
Still need deeper clarity on when to prefer polynomial regression and KNN trade-offs.

## Next
Write concise notes and implement small examples.
